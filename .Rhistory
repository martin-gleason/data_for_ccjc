```
```{r, trickquestionThree, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```
### Chart Example
```{r, badchart, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
bad_height %>% kable() %>% kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = TRUE)
```
### Excercise: How did I mislead you?
* Look at the graphs below and point out what you would do different?
```{r, side_by_side, include = TRUE, warning = FALSE, fig.show = "asis", echo = FALSE}
total_height
total_height_bar
```
### Correct Way to Visualize
```{r, correct_viz, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
total_height_sex_histogram
total_height_chart %>% kable(caption = "All Measurements in cm") %>%
kable_styling("striped", "bordered", full_width = FALSE)
```

*  Take care of your clients and cases
*  Two breaks are built in, but get up and go if you got to go
*  Ask questions, even ones that seem obvious
*  Be willing to be challenged

*  To become fluent with the language of data
*  To think critically about data
*  To become familiar with the fundamentals of OUR data
+ What we collect
+ How we collect it
+ Why we need it
*  What we can do to improve our Data Quality

# Descriptive Statistics
>  "Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire or sample population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread)."
---
# Measures of Central Tendency and Variablity
* Mean: Average
--
* Median: Equal point in the distribution
--
* Mode: Most Frequent number
--
* Range: Minimum number to maximum number
--
* Variance: How spread out the data points are
--
* Standard Deviation: The distance, in the same unit, between data points
